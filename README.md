# firebase-dynamiclinks-playground


[DISCLAIMER]
This project contains a sample application to demonstrate the usage of some of Firebase Dynamic Links capabilities.

It has no architecture at all, the data is just hardcoded and does not come from an API. It does not represent how I would've architectured the code.
